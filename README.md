###Summary

- Live-voting is a realtime polling/voting tool that can be used in situations which have one person speaking in front of an audience.
- The primary benefit of using this tool is to get a quick heartbeat response from your audience. Or as we like to call it, a quick litmus test.
- A few example usages:
	- Educational context
	- Conferences
	- Annual General Meetings
	- Conference calls
